 SHORT ANSWERS
    // TODO FOR HOMEWORK: Answer each question, and note many don't have a 'right answer' so just answer honestly
    [ ] What is the purpose of a constructor
         ANSWER HERE:

    [ ] This project uses 'inheritance' for each shape, since they all have 'BaseShape' as their parent.
        In your own words define what you believe 'inheritance' means.
        ANSWER HERE:

    [ ] Research the concept of 'Object Oriented Programming (OOP)', and write down the 4 principles of 'OOP'.
        ANSWER HERE:
            1)
            2)
            3)
            4)

    [ ] What are some advantages of 'inheritance'
        ANSWER HERE:

    [ ] In the ShapeFactory.java class, there are two methods both called CreateShape.
        One method takes in 3 parameters - Shape Name, length and height
        One method takes in 2 parameters - Shape Name and length

        This concept is called 'polymorphism', research 'polymorphism' and write below why Factory used 'polymorphism'
        ANSWER HERE:

    [ ] Does this project ever cover the concept of 'Abstraction'? If yes, how so?
        ANSWER HERE:

    [ ] Does this project ever cover the concept of 'Encapsulation'? If yes, how so?
        ANSWER HERE:

    [ ] Why did you need to 'override' the 'area' and 'perimeter' methods in 'EquilateralTriangle.java' but not the
        'Square.java' and 'Rectangle.java'?
        ANSWER HERE:

    [ ] We made 'ShapeTests' differently than we did 'SquareTest', 'RectangleTest' and 'EquilateralTriangleTest'
        A unit test is testing a single unit and generally that means by classes in java.
        'SquareTest', 'RectangleTest' and 'EquilateralTriangleTest' are all unit tests.
        'ShapeTests' was testing with each shape as a generic 'BaseShape' instead of the previous shape classes.
        Is 'ShapeTests' a unit test of 'ShapeFactory.java'?
